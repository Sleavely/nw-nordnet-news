# Nordnet News Parser

This is pretty much a hack that I threw together for myself and I don't expect it to work for long, but since it involves bank accounts I thought it'd be a good idea to keep it open source.

Want the ready-to-use version? Check out [Releases](https://github.com/Sleavely/nw-nordnet-news/releases).

## How it works

The app logs in as you on Nordnet and then once per minute it refreshes the "[press releases](https://www.nordnet.se/mux/web/analys/nyheter/nyheterPressmeddelanden.html)" page with a filter for your portfolio only.

## Privacy

I like money. You like money. Nobody likes getting hacked; That's why the only data that is saved by the app is which news items it has already shown you. The only site the app communicates with is Nordnet.
